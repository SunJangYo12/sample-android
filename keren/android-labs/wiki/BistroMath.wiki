BistroMath is a specialized calculator for solving "bistromatic" problems which involve numbers on a a waiters check-pad and people in restaurants. 

Given the amount on the bill, we can quickly calculate tax, tip, how to divide equally among N people or convert into another currency.

The goal is to be as quick and efficient as possible. In a standard case, to calculate the amount to be payed on a check of 100, this would mean - launch the BistroMath application, tap directly on the on-screen virtual keypad '1' - '0' - '0' and read the result! No fumbling with the keyboard or navigating multiple screens or dialogs.


== Changing Inputs ==

If any of the other input parameters are not set correctly, adjust them by selecting which field to update by menu or touch-screen and use the keypad to enter a new value. All other fields will again instantly update themselves. Fields which currently are not applicable are hidden in the display - to enter a value, select it using the menu option.

The inputable fields are (select from menu or tap on screen to modify):\n
  * Price: total amount of restaurant bill (pre or post tax depending on the situation)
  * Tax: tax rate applied to price\n
  * Tip: tipping rate applied to price\n
  * Split: number of people among which to divide the bill equally\n
  * FX Rate: currency conversion rate between the local currency of the restaurant and the users own currency in case of international travel.

See display fields for "Total" or "Per Person" amount for how much should be paid based on the above input.

== Before or after tax? ==
Depending on local custom or you preference, you can calculate tip before or after tax. By setting a tax rate (menu->Tax and enter the tax rate number) and a tipping rate (menu->Tip and enter the desired percentage for the tip), both values are now calculated separately based on the pre-tax amount of the bill.
